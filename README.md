## Introduction
**Projects Aim**: I'm currently learning HTML and CSS as part of the Codecademy Fullstack course. This was a project prompt where we were provided basic design specs and how we built and coded the page was completely up to us.
I used some responsive design concepts that we just learned prior with flexbox. I also took the liberty of adding jump links for a sense of functionality.

## Technologies
The things that I used to build this landing page were:
  * VSCode
  * HTML5
  * CSS
  * Git CMD
  * Images and video provided by Codecademy
## Status
This project is marked as complete.
